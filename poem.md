Markdown is a simple markup langauge often used to format notes or documents, using various symbols to indicate when the text should be changed in size, such as with headers, or if the text should be emphasized in bold or underlined. There's a variety of markdown applications available, each with slight variations to formatting, but overall the language is meant to be understandable regardless of whether the text is fully rendered. Some applications have text previews to immediately show how the text will look when converted from Markdown to html, but the preview isn't essential due to how the language is structured.

# The Raven

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
...

Waiting for a tapping sound, or perhaps just a howling hound,

The night air was still, it was silent until,

Amid crashing and a yowl, through the window tumbled a cat in need of a towel.
